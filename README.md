=== PLANNING MATERIALS ===

=== User Stories ===

Upon visiting the site, users see a landing page with a brief overview of the site's purpose and links to resources/sleep-science and sign up. The navbar at the top has links to an about page, resources page, login, and sign up. Clicking on the name of the site brings the user back to this homepage. 

Clicking the about button will take the user to a page with a more detailed description of the site, why the site was created, and a short bio of the site creator. 

Clicking the signup button or login button will take the user to a page requesting their user information to either sign-up or login. Each page will have a link at the bottom that links to the other page. Once a user signs up or logs in, they will be redirected to their profile.

A userâ€™s profile will consist of their username and profile photo/avatar, as well as all the journal entries they have created (newest first). There is a search bar at the top of the page to make accessing different entries easier. There is also a create button for creating private journal entries. 

The journal feed page has all public dream journal entries. Like the profile page, it also has a create journal entry button and a search bar. Journal entries created here will be public by default. Users can select individual posts by clicking the card and are redirected to the show page for that entry.

The journal show page has the journal entry at the top of the page and all comments for that journal entry beneath it. The user has buttons to select whether to update the entry, delete the entry, or make it public.

Selecting a create or update button brings the user to one of the forms to create or update the journal entry. Update pages have the users information saved so it is easily updatable. 

Clicking the logout button in the navbar will log the user out and return them to the homepage.
